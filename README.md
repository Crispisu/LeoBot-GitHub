The simple web API developed in Python simulates the Szondi Test.
Its purpose is to collect data to build a Machine Learning model.
The app does not store any personal info, except a generic PatientID number which the user needs to remember in order to complete all stages of the test
The app uses PostgreSQL and is configured to work in a Heroku App Service
